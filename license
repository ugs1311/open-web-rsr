### Conclusion  

With this structure and these updated files, your project is organized efficiently for collaboration on GitHub, with clear separation of concerns (Dockerfile, Jenkinsfile, Kubernetes configurations, and application code).   

Make sure to replace placeholder values in these files (like `your-image-name`, `your-app`, etc.) with actual values relevant to your application. If you need any more adjustments or additional information, feel free to ask!
